## Overview

I have been watching the "agent extensions" space turn into a bit of a jungle. Everyone wants their AI assistant to be better at a specific task, but the way we get there is now split across two very different philosophies. On one side you have **Claude Skills** (model-invoked guidance). On the other you have **Kiro Powers** (IDE-invoked guidance plus tools). Same goal. Different wiring.

If you only remember one line, make it this: **Skills teach the model. Powers equip the model.**

## The Short Version

If you care about **portability and speed of authoring**, Skills are your friend. If you care about **end-to-end execution**, Powers are the clear winner. I like Skills for teaching and Powers for doing.

## Claude Skills: The Model Pulls the Playbook

Claude Skills are packaged guidance modules that the **model itself** decides to load. A skill is typically a `SKILL.md` file with a short description and the instructions the model should follow when a task matches the skill's scope. This is clean and lightweight, which is why skills have taken off across tools. See the official [Claude Skills overview](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview) and [how to create skills](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/12512198-how-to-create-custom-skills).

**What a good Skill includes:**

- A tight description with clear triggers.
- A repeatable process the model can follow.
- Examples that reduce ambiguity.
- References that keep it grounded.

**Why I like Skills:**

- Easy to write and share.
- Easy to reason about.
- They improve output quality without changing your tooling.
- The [skills.sh ecosystem](https://skills.sh/docs) makes discovery painless.

**Where they fall short:**

- No real tool access.
- Depends on the model triggering the right thing at the right time.
- Fragmented setups across IDEs if your team uses different stacks.

## Kiro Powers: The IDE Brings the Toolbox

Kiro Powers are AWS Kiro's answer to the same problem, but with a more "full stack" philosophy. A power is not just guidance. It is **guidance plus tooling**. Kiro's [Powers documentation](https://kiro.dev/docs/powers/) explains how the IDE loads a power based on trigger keywords and injects its guidance along with the tools (via the [Model Context Protocol](https://kiro.dev/docs/mcp/)).

Each power typically includes:

1. `POWER.md` (steering and activation triggers)
2. MCP configuration (tools and permissions)
3. Optional hooks or sub-guides

**Why Powers are strong:**

- They let the agent take action, not just give advice.
- They keep context clean by loading only what is relevant.
- They remove the "but how do I run this?" gap.

**The trade-offs:**

- You are currently tied to Kiro.
- Authoring takes more setup.
- Tool permissions need to be managed carefully.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Dimension | Claude Skills | Kiro Powers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Activation | Model-invoked | IDE/environment-invoked |
| Scope | Guidance only | Guidance + tools |
| Files | `SKILL.md` | `POWER.md` + MCP configs |
| Portability | High | Low (today) |
| Authoring effort | Low | Medium to high |
| Best for | Guidance, best practices | Execution, workflows |

## What Breaks in Real Life

This is where the glossy demos end.

- **Skills fail silently** if the triggers are too broad or too narrow.
- **Powers can be over-permissioned** if you are not careful with tool access.
- **Teams split across tools** end up maintaining parallel systems (skills here, powers there).

## Integration Strategies (Do This Today)

### 1) Manual Injection (Fastest)

If you just need a skill once, paste the guidance into the chat or a project note. It is not elegant, but it works.

### 2) Convert Skills into Powers (Best Long-Term)

If you rely on a skill weekly, convert it into a power:

- Move guidance into `POWER.md`.
- Translate triggers into power keywords.
- Add any supporting files.
- Decide if you need MCP tools.

### 3) Build a "Skill Loader" Power (Ambitious)

A meta-power can fetch skills on demand and inject them into context. This is not mainstream yet, but it is the logical bridge if you are all-in on Kiro and you love the skills ecosystem.

## My Recommendation (Based on How Teams Actually Work)

If you are experimenting, use Skills. If you are shipping, use Powers. If your team straddles both, pick the **three most valuable skills** and convert them into powers. That gives you 80 percent of the value without drowning in migration work.
